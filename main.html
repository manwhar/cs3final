            <h1>Exhibit One - YouTube Channel</h1>
            <p>Over four years and hundreds of hours, I've created dozens of YouTube videos exploring Minecraft programming. These projects have developed my video editing, communication, and storytelling skills in ways that the former me could only dream of.</p>

            <h1>Poetry Writing</h1>
            <p>I was a Menlo Park Youth Poetry Contest winner in 2024. Here's the poem I wrote:</p>
            <p><font size='3' face='papyrus'>Driving up the overpass<br/>
                My face is pressed up on the glass<br/>
                My breath comes soft, in calming waves<br/>
                And I'm content in my own brain<br/><br/>
                
                Your gentle laugh floats through the air<br/>
                It fills my cup to know you care<br/>
                The cars are sparse, the road is wide<br/>
                My thoughts so tranquil as you drive<br/><br/>
                
                I'll stop a sec to take it in<br/>
                And save this memory with a pin<br/>
                The air today is oh-so clear<br/>
                A thousand miles I could peer<br/><br/>
                
                And see the sky with textured clouds<br/>
                And pink and golden highlight shrouds<br/>
                They wrap around the stratosphere<br/>
                And save their tears for future years<br/><br/>
                
                It frankly takes my breath away<br/>
                And makes me wonder as I sway<br/>
                When did I make this mental switch?<br/>
                To think of clouds and think of this<br/><br/>
                
                Is my mind becoming clear?<br/>
                Or is the sky just good this year?<br/>
                The mental shutter closes leaf<br/>
                A moment saved and on repeat<br/><br/>
                
                And now my mind drifts back to here<br/>
                To your voice wafting warm sweet smears<br/>
                I peel my face bones off the glass<br/>
                You drive us down the overpass<br/><br/>
